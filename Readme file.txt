SentinelOps Autonomous DevOps Platform


SentinelOps is an AI-powered autonomous DevOps platform that continuously monitors system metrics, detects anomalies, and predicts potential failures in advance. It uses machine learning models for risk scoring and incident detection, automatically triggers remediation actions to minimize downtime, and logs incidents for visibility and analysis. By combining real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and self-healing automation, SentinelOps improves reliability while reducing manual intervention and resolution time.
